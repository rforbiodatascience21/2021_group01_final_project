## Introduction
<font size = "3">Data was pulled on 27. April 2021 and is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease?fbclid=IwAR3SbR6Eo3ow8dYal4mTv321XOUAUg8yw5g_WY-eDz9hUQS_0jJ0-qTR9v8 

Created in 1988 by:

- Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.

- University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.

- University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.

- V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

- Contains information of heart patients from 4 locations: 
Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland and Long Beach. </font>

<font size = "5">Goal of study</font>

- <font size = "3">Perform visual analysis of data distribution
- Try to predict if patients have heart disease or not according to features in the dataset (PCA, K-means, Binomial regression)
</font>

## Materials and methods: Data processing
<font size = "5">
`-`  Data processing, modeling and creation of presentation was performed in Rstudio Cloud.

`-`  Way of coding follows O'Reillys R for Data Science by Wickham and Grolemund 

`-`  Data wrangling was achieved through _piping_ (`%>%`) 

`-`  Whole project exists at github at: 
https://github.com/rforbiodatascience21/2021_group01_final_project

## Data wrangling and cleaning 
### Data Import
- <font size = "4">Modified version of data sets was used</font>
- <font size = "4">Identifiers for the variables was not released for raw data </font>
- <font size = "4">14/76 attributes was used</font>
- <font size = "4">The Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date</font>
- <font size = "4">Example of raw data collected from Cleveland </font>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data_raw <- read_csv("../data/_raw/processed.cleveland.data")
print(data_raw, width = 80, n = 4, n_extra = 1)

#load("/cloud/project/results/04_Summary_table.RData")
#kable(Summary_table,format = "html", digits = 3)%>%
#  kable_styling(font_size = 12)%>%
#  column_spec(1:4,width = "1.5cm")%>%
#  column_spec(4, width = "2cm")
```

## Data Cleaning 
- <font size = "4"> Joined together the 4 data frames by xx </font>
- <font size = "4"> Handling of missing values </font>
- <font size = "4"> Number of NAs differed across variables </font>
- <font size = "4"> Clean small dataset vs large dataset w. NAs </font>

## Tidying and wrangling data
<font size = "4">Data was augmented by creating new more insightful columns</font>

- <font size = "4">Created categorical age groups for patients, location, diagnosis of disease, sex, chest pain type, fasting blood sugar,  resting electrocardiographic, exercise induced angina, slope of ST and thal</font>

## Descriptive data analysis and visualisations
- <font size = "4">Distribution according to disease presence</font>
- <font size = "4">General thoughts for data composition</font>
- <font size = "4">Data seems balanced</font>

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kable(Summary_table,format = "html", digits = 3)%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 12)%>%

## Unsupervised learning: Results from PCA 
- Data wrangling and handling of NAs 
- Regions in which the majority of the pool of observations show consistency in presence/absence of disease
- The first three PCs account for ~70% of the total variance
- Indicating that we should be able to separate observations with presence of disease from absence of disease

## Unsupervised learning: Kmeans Cluster

## Supervised learning: Prediction model based on presence of heart disease 
- <font size = "4">Two binomial regression was created:</font>
  - <font size = "4">The first binomial Regression model predicts the odds of being diagnosed with a heart disease, given the participants age</font>
  - <font size = "4">The first binomial Regression model predicts the odds of being diagnosed with a heart disease, given the participants age, gender and type of chest pain</font>

## Supervised learning: Binomial model

## Confusion matrix
```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("/cloud/project/results/05_Matrix_conf.RData")
Matrix_conf1 <- Matrix_conf %>%
  select(Model_formular,`True Positive`,`False Positive`,`False Negative`,`True Negative`)
Matrix <- Matrix_conf %>%
  select(Model_formular,accuracy,Precision,Recall,F_score)

kable(Matrix_conf1,format = "html", digits = 3)%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 14)
kable(Matrix,format = "html", digits = 3)%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 14)
```

- Based on the result of from the confusion matrix, it intuitively seems that the second is the better predictor model
- This is further illustrated by the result of the in the second table:
  -  The precision estimates how well the model is when the predictions a diagnosis of heart disease
  - The recall estmale how well the model is to correctly predict a diagnosis of hear disease
  - The accuracy is an estimation of how often the model correctly classify a participant.
  - The F score is a is the weighted average that makes comparing model easier.
  - As can be seen in the table the accuracy, precision, recall and F score is higher for the second model, which means the second model is the better model

## Discussion
### Considerations concerning the data used 
- Missing information as a result of removing rows containing NA
### Biological insights 
- which variables contribute to prediction. 
- Prevalence of symptoms e.g xx is more abundant for patient with heart disease 
- Non of the binomial models are good enough for medical use because 20% to 30% of the patients will be wrongly classified
