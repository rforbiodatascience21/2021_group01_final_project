## Introduction

Introduction to study by xx et. al 
- Original data
  - example of raw data collected from Cleveland 
```{r, message = FALSE}
data_raw <- read_csv("../data/_raw/processed.cleveland.data")
print(data_raw, width = 80, n = 4, n_extra = 1)
```
- Additional data includes data collected from Hungary, Switzerland and Long Beach 

## Goal of study
- Perform visual analysis of data distribution
- Classify if patients have heart disease or not according to features in the dataset (PCA, K-means, Binomial regression)

## Materials and methods: Data processing
- Data processing, modeling and creation of presentation was performed in Rstudio Cloud.
- Way of coding follows O'Reillys R for Data Science by Wickham and Grolemund  
- Whole project exists at github at: 
https://github.com/rforbiodatascience21/2021_group01_final_project

## Project outline 
- Loading and cleaning data
  - Add location variable 
  - Join data sets 
- Augmentation of data
  - Create categorical variables 
- Analysis and Visualisations
  - Distribution of presence of heart disease across physiological variables.
- Unsupervised analysis
  - PCA
  - K-means clustering
- Supervised classification model
  - Binomial regression

## Analysis and visualisations
- Distribution according to disease presence
- Colored by presence of disease

```{r, message = FALSE}
load("/cloud/project/results/04_Summary_table.RData")
kable(Summary_table,format = "html", digits = 3)%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 12)%>%
  column_spec(1:4,width = "1.5cm")%>%
  column_spec(4, width = "2cm")
```


## Analysis and visualisations
- Distribution according to disease presence
- Colored by presence of disease
- Distribution of observations with presence of disease and absence of disease is equal

## Unsupervised and supervised learning
- Handling of NAs

## Unsupervised learning: Results from PCA 
- Handling of NA and selection of data 
- Regions in which the majority of the pool of observations show consistency in presence/absence of disease
- Indicating that we should be able to separate observations with presence of disease from absence of disease

## Supervised learning: Prediction model based on presence of heart disease 

- Two binomial regression was created:
  - The first binomial Regression model predicts the odds of being diagnosed with a heart disease, given the participants age
  - The first binomial Regression model predicts the odds of being diagnosed with a heart disease, given the participants age, gender and type of chest pain

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("/cloud/project/results/05_Matrix_conf.RData")
Matrix_conf1 <- Matrix_conf %>%
  select(Model_formular,`True Positive`,`False Positive`,`False Negative`,`True Negative`)
Matrix <- Matrix_conf %>%
  select(Model_formular,accuracy,Precision,Recall,F_score)

kable(Matrix_conf1,format = "html", digits = 3)%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 14)
kable(Matrix,format = "html", digits = 3)%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 14)
```

- Based on the result of from the confusion matrix, it intuitively seems that the second is the better predictor model
- This is further illustrated by the result of the in the second table:
  -  The precision estimates how well the model is when the predictions a diagnosis of heart disease
  - The recall estmale how well the model is to correctly predict a diagnosis of hear disease
  - The accuracy is an estimation of how often the model correctly classify a participant.
  - The F score is a is the weighted average that makes comparing model easier.
  - As can be seen in the table the accuracy, precision, recall and F score is higher for the second model, which means the second model is the better model 

## Discussion


- Non of the binomial models are good enough for medical use because 20% to 30% of the patients will be wrongly clasified
