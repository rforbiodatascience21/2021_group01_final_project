## Description
This project does different R analysis on the heart data set:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease?fbclid=IwAR3SbR6Eo3ow8dYal4mTv321XOUAUg8yw5g_WY-eDz9hUQS_0jJ0-qTR9v8
This data set is collected from people that have suspected heart issues in Long Beach, Hungary, Cleveland and Switzerland. A total of 920 patients and 14 variables with location information was used.

Datasets from all four countries are included in our analysis. Before using the data, our R script joins all the datasets cleans it, and augments it using tidyverse methods (scripts 02_clean.R and 03_augment.R). This data is used in different analysis that creates plots which are converted into png files and loaded into an R markdown IO slides presentation.

## Data 
Attribute Information:

1. The age of the participates in the study in years    

2. The gender of the  participates

    * 0 = female

    * 1 = male

3. The type of chest pain

    * 1 = typical angina

    * 2 = atypical angina

    * 3 = non-anginal pain

    * 4 = asymptomatic

4. The resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital  

5. The serum cholestoral in $\frac{mg}{dl}$    

6. The fasting blood sugar

    * 0 = fasting blood sugar $< 120 \frac{mg}{dl}$

    * 1 = fasting blood sugar $> 120 \frac{mg}{dl}$

7. The result of the resting electrocardiographic

    * 0 = normal

    * 1 = ST  and/or T wave abnormality

    * 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy

8. The maximum heart rate achieved   

9. Exercise induced angina

    * 1 = yes

    * 0 = no

10. ST depression induced by exercise relative to resting stage   

11. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment

    * 1 = upsloping

    * 2 = flat

    * 3 = downsloping

12. The number of major vessels colored by flourosopy

    * $0\leq Major\ vessels\leq 3$

13. The defect type of thalassemia

    * 3 = normal

    * 6 = fixed defect

    * 7 = reversable defect

14. The diagnosis of heart disease

    * 0 = no heart disease present

    * [1;4] = types of heart disease 

## Installation
In order to get the all the project files clone the following repository from git: 
git clone https://github.com/rforbiodatascience21/2021_group01_final_project

## Software:
The following software needs to be installed for running the code locally:

- R

For running non-local, an Rstudio Cloud session can be used: https://rstudio.cloud/

## Requirements

The following packages needs to be installed inside R for the scripts to function:

- library(tidyverse)
- library(ggplot2)
- library(ggpubr)
- library(broom)
- library(cowplot)
- library(GGally)
- library(rlang)
- library(viridis)

## Usage
Make sure that in an R session, the project files are all cloned and every requirement is installed. Run the 00_doit.R script found under the "R" folder. This will run all necessary scripts to make the raw data into png files and generate the presentation document. The presentation document is found in the "doc" folder named "Presentation_IOslides.html".
